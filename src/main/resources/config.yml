# This plugin uses PlaceholderAPI for message variables.
# - You can find the full list of available placeholders here: https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI/wiki/Placeholders
# - NOTE: You must manually install expansions to use them (e.g., run /papi ecloud download Player and /papi reload).

# Message formatting is powered by MiniMessage.
# - Documentation: https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html
# - Use tags like <red>, <bold>, or <gradient:red:blue> for modern styling.
